# BEM_HBM_1D

Author: Tianzheng Lu

This is the python version of a numeircal method for Nonsmooth Modal Analysis (NSA). The method combines boundary element method (BEM) and harmonic balance method (HBM). 
Technical details of this numerical method could refer to paper:

Lu, T., Legrand, M. Nonsmooth modal analysis via the boundary element method for one-dimensional bar systems. Nonlinear Dyn 107, 227â€“246 (2022). DOI:10.1007/s11071-021-06994-z

Current version only supports NSA of Dirichlet-Signorini system, which is discussed as the first example in the paper. Other applications will be updated in the coming versions.
